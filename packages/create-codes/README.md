## Getting Started

To develop locally, you can use the `pnpm dev` command.

This will enable watch mode, which triggers a rebuild whenever changes are made.

### Adding the environment variables file

Copy `.env.template` to `.env` for your local environment configuration.

Note: The `.env` file should not be committed to Git and is meant for local usage only.
